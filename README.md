## Quarterly reviews
It's intended to be a simple app for performing quarterly employee reviews. Doing those is (at the time of writing) is one of my duties as a team leader and I am annoyed by the need to send doc/odt documents back and forth via email, between me, my team mates and my manager. I thought of creating a simple document sharing application, intended to be both useful as a tool (if it ever gets to some usable state) and as a pet project (was lacking and idea for it).

# Initial ideas
*  implement the first version of the app in pure Java (or maybe Scala?), without any frameworks (which pollute our brains)
* make authentication/authorization pluggable (with LDAP plugin initially)
* make data storage pluggable (with MongoDB and/or CouchDB plugins initially)
* create some working version fullfilling my basic needs
* use JDK 7 to try out new features

# Licence
The application is licenced under [DWTFYWPL](http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/COPYING), Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License.
